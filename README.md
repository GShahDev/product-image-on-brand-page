# product-image-on-brand-page
This code displays the first available product image from the collection list on the brand page or any other page.

We have created a brand page that lists all the vendor collections, and we wanted to display the first available product image as a featured image. 

First, create vendor.collection.liquid on the section file from the above file. 

Then I created a seperate file to mention the code to display the first available product image from the vendor collection.
